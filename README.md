The solution has been redesigned with an architecture that respects the different layers (for the purposes of corrective and evolutionary maintenance):

    1- Presentation API Layer: Handles user interface and API communication, providing endpoints for client requests and delivering responses.
    2- Business Layer: Contains the core business logic of the application, processing data, implementing business rules, and interacting with repositories. It also includes Dependency Injection Extensions to configure services, and handles customer orders and notifications through services that manage business workflows (e.g., OrderService for processing orders and NotificationService for sending notifications).
    3- Data Access Layer: Includes Unit of Work, Repositories, and Context, as well as Code First migration files for managing the database schema changes. This layer abstracts data interactions and ensures consistency through transactional operations.
    4- DTO Layer: Manages communication with the client side through Data Transfer Objects, which facilitate the transfer of data in a simplified and decoupled manner.
    5- Entities Layer: Defines the core business entities that represent the domain objects and correspond to database tables, containing the raw data structure and business behavior.
    6- Testing Layer: (Not yet completed) dedicated to unit and integration testing of the application. This layer ensures that each component is functioning correctly and that the system works as a whole.

This architecture ensures clear separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability, making the system easier to maintain, evolve, and test over time. Each layer is isolated, promoting flexibility and scalability as the application grows or changes.
